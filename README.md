# Pebble app for grabbing data from [aqicn.org](aqicn.org)

This is a very simple and fragile wrapper around the API from http://aqicn.org/faq/2015-07-28/air-quality-widget-new-improved-feed/.

Currently it only works for Beijing. It loads the data when you open the app and again every 5 minutes after that.

Press select to read the attribution. It seems to pull from the US Embassy by default; I hope to make this configurable in the future.

If you are from aqicn.org and are reading this: please get in touch! I would love to hand this code over to you.

I have only tested this app on my own Pebble Time Steel. If you would like to help by testing/contributing fixes for other Pebble versions, please get in touch or submit a pull request.
